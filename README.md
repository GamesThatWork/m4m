# MUNITIONS FOR MISSION

A game for young visitors to a military museum.
It is intended to stimulate their interest in STEM.

### Game

This is a short game with little replayability. 
Although installation of four machines in the museum offers goood throughput, it will be challenging. 
Most visitors arrive in schoolbuses. Large numbers of children must pass through the game relatively quickly. 
Our goal is to deliver a satisfying 90 second experience with a score that can be compare with one's friends.
